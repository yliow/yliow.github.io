<h2>How to give a talk (end-of-semester CS presentation version)</h2>
    
For most class or personal projects:

<ul>
<li>Be prepared
<li>No special dress code (please)
<li>For student projects (depending on the number of students), you usually have about 10-15 minutes. For larger projects such as senior seminars, you usually have 20-30 minutes.
<li>Have some presentation slides with your name, class, project title, goals of the project. You can include an algorithm/idea/design if you think itâ€™s interesting. For small class projects probably <= 3 slides. For large projects such as senior seminar or you have done some serious research, maybe 10 slides.
<li>The presentation:
    <ul>
    <li>Introduce yourself
    <li>State the course
    <li>State the project: name, general goals of the project.
    <li>Do a demo.
    <li>Explain some of the features implemented, mention problems solved, etc.
    <li>Mention features you have not completed, problems met, etc.
    <li>Mention future work (if any) on the project.
    <li>Ask if there are questions.
    <li>For larger projects (senior seminar types) you will probably give an overview of proofs.
    </ul>
