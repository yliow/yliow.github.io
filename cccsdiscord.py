Hey everyone, <br><br>

As you all probably know by now the campus is shutting down and will be going all online. Obviously this will effect hangout hours. So here’s where we’re at: <br><br>

We will still have Hangout Hours today. This will be the last time we meet this spring. <br><br>

For the rest of the semester the work study students will be deciding what to do to still offer help to anyone who would like it. Right now I’m think a discord server will be our best option, but if you have any suggestions feel free to let me know. <br><br><br>

Thanks,<br>
