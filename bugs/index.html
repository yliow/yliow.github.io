    <p>
      To contribute, put your code into a directory named yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.
      Put a README.txt in your directory.
      The README.txt should include some info on the program such as
      course number and assignment number, etc.
      If it's a personal project, describe the project.
      Nobody is going to read it if it contains too much irrelevant junk.
      So prune it down to the relevant parts.
      Remove executables.
      If it's an assignment, you can include the pdf.
      Gzip and tar and send to me.
