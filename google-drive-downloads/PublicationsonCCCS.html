In order to better his educational opportunities, he moved in with his older brother in the capital city of Kathmandu to complete his final two years of schooling. He dreamed of studying abroad to go to college, but knew there was no way that could happen without a scholarship. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, a former student from that school in Kathmandu had paved that very path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was there that he met a student by the name of Bibek Poudel, who had returned home during a break in his studies at Columbia College. Poudel had earned a Presidential Scholarship to CC, was double-majoring in computer science and mathematics, and encouraged Bhattarai to apply. &ldquo;He was so kind to help me with learning more about Columbia College,&rdquo; Bhattarai said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Poudel, who was himself recruited to CC by another Nepali, Ujjwal Pandey, is currently working at Precise Software in the Washington, D.C., area. Ujjwal is currently working at Amazon.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bhattarai feverishly started working on improving his English skills once he moved to Kathmandu, but as with many languages, learned that there&rsquo;s a difference between formal and conversational English. &ldquo;My writing was very poor and my speaking was abysmal, but I knew I had to get better, so I started hanging out with tourists at the temples in Kathmandu. That&rsquo;s really how I learned to speak English.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard enough that there are 10 different ways to say something in English,&rdquo; Bhattarai says with a grin. &ldquo;I could communicate, but I wasn&rsquo;t as funny as I&rsquo;d like to be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He continued to improve, and when it was time to apply for the Presidential Scholarship at Columbia College, he was ready. Liow was one of his interviewers at Scholarship Day, and knew he would be successful. &ldquo;Saurav is a fast learner and quick thinker,&rdquo; Liow says.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>For his part, Bhattarai credits everyone who has helped him get to this point: Dr. Liow, Poudel, various staff members in </span><span class="c8"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ccis.edu/directory/admissions&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684949012083347&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Pul-dusYgzUV4WhcH_ocU">Admissions</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ccis.edu/directory/international-center&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684949012083491&amp;usg=AOvVaw1b_lx6aUHFN7qrtLvLS7qt">International Student Services</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ccis.edu/directory/grossnickle-career-services-center&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684949012083616&amp;usg=AOvVaw2V5OUN52gfRMiTVNqP-3KU">Career Services</a></span><span class="c1">, his colleagues in student government and fellow international students he&rsquo;s met on campus. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really grateful for the international community we have at Columbia College.

      <span class="c1">Julia Collins wasn&rsquo;t sure what she wanted to major in when she was first accepted to Columbia College.</span></p>

<p>
  Coming out of Hannibal High School, she had already taken college-level Calculus I and II courses, so she knew she had a knack for mathematics. She gravitated toward the Computer and Math Sciences Department on registration day and, as luck would have it, Associate Professor of Computer Science Dr. Yihsiang Liow was staffing the room at that time.</p>

<p>
  &ldquo;I just remember Dr. Liow and I hitting it off right away,&rdquo; Collins says. &ldquo;We had a great conversation. I knew that I just wanted to get a job after college. He said, if you come to the computer science program at Columbia College, you will have a job after you graduate. I was like, &lsquo;sold.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Collins graduated from the Day Campus in May 2014 and started her first job at a data analytics consulting firm in Chicago the next month. Now, she works as a product manager for WorkMarket, a startup company under the ADP umbrella based in New York City.</p>

<p>She is not alone. Columbia College computer science graduates currently work for such internationally known companies as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Lockheed Martin, Bayer, Cerner, Intel and Microsoft, as well as companies such as MidwayUSA, Veterans United and Carfax that are integral to the Columbia community.

<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively small department that is carving out quite a reputation of producing highly qualified and competent graduates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do the math on return on investment for your college degree, the computer science degree at CC has to be the best in the region,&rdquo; Collins says. </p>

<p>Here are some stories of how the Columbia College computer science program has benefited its students.

  <h3>Sam Luebbert &rsquo;14</h3>

<p>Application Development Manager | MidwayUSA, Columbia, Missouri</p>
<br>

<p>Unlike Collins, Sam Luebbert had been exposed to computer programming before he started at Columbia College.
  Still, he wasn&rsquo;t sure he wanted to jump straight into the computer science program.
  <br>
  
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before he realized that was the place for him.</p>
<br>

<p>&ldquo;At times the program was tough, but I appreciated it and never again wavered in my growing passion for computer science,&rdquo; Luebbert says.
  <br>
  
<p>Luebbert spent a year as an application developer intern at MidwayUSA while he was still attending Columbia College. He had a job waiting for him as an application developer upon graduation. After a few years, he was promoted to his current position, where he manages a team of three developers.</p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Liow says that the mission of the Columbia College computer science program is to not only prepare its graduates for their first job out of school but to equip them with the necessary skills to put them in prime position for promotions down the line.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When they join a company, they understand how to talk to people and what the requirements are for their software, that they have the ability to analyze a problem, design solutions and produce or program a solution for their client. That&rsquo;s the minimum,&rdquo; Liow says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough to just know your textbook.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Columbia College computer science courses emphasize project-based learning and collaboration with fellow students. That way, graduates are well-prepared to move beyond the theory when they enter the workforce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The instructors often emphasized to students that the skills within computer science were not the only ingredient for success out in the real world,&rdquo; Luebbert says. &ldquo;This is absolutely true, as most software development supports a business. You can get ahead if you care about and understand the business versus just your coding.&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.x16igoaxy1ig"><span class="c10">Ryan Frappier &rsquo;17</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Software Engineer | Google, Mountain View, California</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first time Ryan Frappier heard about the Columbia College computer science program was from Nathaniel Graham, his teacher at the Columbia Area Career Center (CACC). Frappier started out at the Career Center learning graphic and web design tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator before moving on to programming.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I thought it was really cool I could just type some random stuff and have a webpage after it,&rdquo; Frappier says. &ldquo;In a professional setting, you&rsquo;re often given code to work with. You need to be able to step through it and understand it. That was something that was really emphasized by Dr. Liow and the program. Understanding how that was so directly applicable was a really good thing for me.&rdquo;</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c24"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 322.50px; height: 257.90px;"><img alt="Ryan Frappier &rsquo;17" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 322.50px; height: 257.90px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c5">Ryan Frappier &rsquo;17</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frappier completed two summer internships at Google during his time at Columbia College and earned a full-time job with the multibillion-dollar revenue corporation after graduation.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Liow places a premium on the sort of community outreach that helps prospective students uncover the hidden gem that is the Columbia College computer science program. The college has run a programming contest for high school students since 2015, a high school internship program through Partners in Education and coding events with middle school students. Liow has also served on the advisory board at the CACC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These sorts of events and connections have helped the program grow in enrollments and recognition since Liow first started at the college in 2003. They have also helped students such as Frappier gain awareness of the program and grow in their interpersonal skills while completing the coursework.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I would not be where I am without the experiences I had at CC,&rdquo; Frappier says. &ldquo;Being a tutor to other CC students and high school students for Dr. Liow made a pretty big impression on me as a whole. Having the opportunity to understand students and help them helped me grow.&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.cii33qmfg2u2"><span class="c10">Michael Fisher, senior</span></h3><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After nearly four years in the Columbia College computer science program, Michael Fisher has a deep appreciation for the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that Liow and the faculty emphasize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fisher was working at Central Bank when, at 23, he decided to go back to school for computer science.

However, after taking Intro to C++ Programming at the Columbia Area Career Center his sophomore year of high school, Frappier&rsquo;s childhood dream of making video games grew into a passion for computer science, which he is currently pursuing at Columbia College. Frappier decided to put the skills he acquired at Columbia College to the test and applied for an internship with Google.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A bit of time passed, and I was contacted by a recruiter from Google to schedule interviews,&rdquo; Frappier says. &ldquo;I had two phone interviews with each being roughly 45 minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A short time later, Google extended an internship offer to Frappier, but his placement was still undetermined. To help with this, Google asked him to complete a questionnaire to narrow down his interests and match him to a project. After one last interview, Frappier was placed in an engineering practicum position with the Chrome web browser team and would be on his way to his new home away from home: Mountain View, California.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As an engineering practicum intern, Frappier worked under the supervision of the project host and co-host to create a tool that would help the engineers on the team. At first, if Frappier came across a challenging code, he would try to solve the problem himself instead of asking someone else.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I soon found that at a big company like Google, you cannot live under a rock. You must communicate with others,&rdquo; he says. What really made an impression on Frappier was the culture of the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One of the coolest things about the culture is that Googlers are encouraged to form and participate in groups that relate to their interests,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I practiced in multiple group activities with my mentor and was amazed that activities such as foam sword fighting or bowling were commonplace at Google!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s right &mdash; Google encourages their &ldquo;Googlers&rdquo; to step away from the stress of work and enjoy the fun environment it cultivates.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Also, I can&rsquo;t forget to mention the free food,&rdquo; Frappier adds. &ldquo;Google&rsquo;s main campus in Mountain View offered several different places to eat, and there was quite a variety.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only was the food &mdash; free food, that is &mdash; noteworthy, but the whole experience gave Frappier a much better feel as to what a software engineer does.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;It has allowed me to confirm to myself that I really want to continue to pursue computer science,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I gained a lot of good experience and made great connections that will most certainly help advance my career.&rdquo;</span></p></body></html>
