    <h2>What is it?</h2>
A day of programming activities, programming contest (in a team of at most 3 members), meeting with CS majors from Columbia College, etc. In short: a day of fun for people who are interested in or wanting to find out more about CS. At this point, the programming language used is C++, Python, and Java.
There are two categories: intermediate and advanced.
There will be prizes!

    <p>
    <span style='color:red'>NEW! BEGINNER CATEGORY!</span>
    For spring 2026, we will have a non-competitive beginner category.
    </p>
    
    <p>    
      <span style='color:red'>NEW! EARLY CHECK-IN OPTION!</span>
    For spring 2026, we are looking into an early check-in option:
    <ul>
      <li>You check in on Friday morning before the contest and meet your host
        (a CS major).
      <li>You have breakfast, lunch, and dinner
        with all the other early check-ins and hosts.
        For dinner, we might go to Columbia downtown (15-minute walk). 
      <li>You attend CS classes, programming contest practice sessions, and CS events.
      <li>You either stay over-night in our dorms with other early check-ins
        and the hosts, or your parents pick you
        up at the end of the day.
      <li>You then attend the contest the next day.
      <li>If we do offer the early check-in option, we will probably limit the number of participants to ~5.
      <li>
        We are working through the early check-in option.
        If you are interested, make sure you say so when you register.
    </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>Are there prizes?</h2>

        <p>
    Yes! There will be tuition scholarship prizes (see below) and cash prizes (probably in the form of Amazon e-gift cards)!
    <!-- For spring 2025, the prizes were $3k scholarship prizes and $800
    cash equivalent prizes.
    For spring 2026, we are aiming for a higher amount!
    Stay tuned! -->
        </p>
