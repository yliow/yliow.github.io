Welcome to PiCS (Portal into Computer Science), the computer science outreach programs of Columbia College (of Missouri).

<h2>Goal</h2>

The goal of PiCS is to introduce K-12 students to the exciting area of Computer Science. We have visited Benton Elementary School and Alpha Hart Lewis Elementary School to talk about computer science and to teach basic programming. In spring 2017 we organized an “Hour of Code” event for Jeff Middle School. We have organized several high school events including an annual High School Programming Contest since spring 2015. We are also organizing several summer camps for middle school and high school students. More programs for elementary school students are forthcoming.

<h2>Students</h2>

Here’s the 2017 summer camps link.

<h2>Teachers</h2>
If your school wishes to partner with Columbia College to promote computer science among your students, please email Dr. Yihsiang Liow (yliow@ccis.edu). We can for instance organize an “Hour of Code” for your school or classes. Here’s our “Hour of Code” event in 3/2017.


<h2>“PiCS”?</h2>
The name PiCS and its logo (the spiral) were created by a group of our CS students, Mr. Nathaniel Graham, and Dr. Yihsiang Liow on 2015/03/30 while planning for the first High School Programming Contest (2015/04). Now they represent our outreach to all K-12 students. 

<h2>Donors and Sponsors</h2> 
To become a donor or sponsor of PiCS to support computer science outreach programs to K-12 students, please email Dr. Yihsiang Liow (yliow@ccis.edu). All donors/sponsors (past, current, and recurring) are acknowledged below (except for anonymous donors).
